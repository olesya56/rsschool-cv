## About me 2
I am 17 years old, at the moment I work as a barista in a coffee shop, but I also had experience working as a waitress in a bar. Having worked in a bar for about a year, I have acquired quite new qualities, such as: sociability, responsiveness, and patience. 


Now I understand that I'm not going to make coffee all my life and it's time to change something. I started to be actively interested in programming and at the moment I really want to graduate from RS SCHOOL and develop as a front-end developer.
